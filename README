# Commentary

For my narrative game I used std::map which is like a dictionary structure, which stores key-value pairs. Since my story is short, a dicitionary is appropriate as it allows me to name scenes and look them up directly. It also supports the branching paths, as player can jump to different scenes based on their choices.
It is also very easy to edit the scenes and paths.
My player choices are stored in a vector, created in each scene, as lists of pairs. The pairs contain the player choice, and the scene which that choice leads to. All of my scenes are stored in a dictionary, which allows access to any scene by its name. The main gameplay loop stores the name of the active scene, displaying the text and choices that come with it. When the player makes a choice, the next scene key is taken from the vector.
